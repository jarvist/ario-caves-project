We have used several different coordinate systems in the past.  The source of
all entrance coordinates should be indicated as follows:

[GN] Gerhard Niklasch et al.'s surface survey from the late 1980s, documented
in OUCC Proc 13, using the European UTM datum.  This is highly accurate.

[GPS-WGS94] Readings from a GPS using the WGS94 UTM datum.

[GPS-Euro] Readings from a GPS using the European datum.

[Old] Old entrance coordinate system, relative to Verdelluenga, using magnetic
north from an unknown year (possibly mixed with some grid norths).  Most of
these are derived from [GN], but some have been tied in via surface survey
(often ignoring magnetic deviation).

In future, we should locate only using the European UTM datum.  

Experiments in 2000 suggested that [GPS-WGS94] differs from [GN] by (107,205),
and that [GPS-Euro] differs from [GN] by (-5,5).  However, in theory the
difference is (99,209), and that is the figure used in the translations.
Here are figures for translating *from* various formats into European datum:

[GPS-WGS94] add (99,209)
[Old]       add (2333.6,7815.3)
