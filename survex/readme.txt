This is the OUCC Survex data from caves explored around Ario and Top Camp
between 1979 and 2000.

Executing the command "survex area" will produce the coordinates.

The subdirectories contain survey data as follows:

- Ario: caves around Ario: 2/7, Xitu (including 3/5 and 12/5), Canalizos, 27/9,
and entrances for Tras La Jayada, La Jayada, 10/9, Jenga, and 53/5;

(data courtesy of Leonese cavers).

Other subdirectories contain information as follows:

- Calib: compass calibration files and information about calibration and
  coordinate systems.

- Symbols: symbols for mountains and unsurveyed caves.

The caves are linked via surface locations of varying accuracy. 

To be done: 

- Use correct compass calibrations for all caves (some caves use the same
calibration for the whole system);

- Incude the following caves: 53/5, 8/11, Optimisto, Skull, 66/5, 1/4, Cabeza
Muxa;

- Tie in F41, Cabeza Coulagua;

- D7 seems to be included under Vasco and separately;

- Obtain data from polish area;

- Find lost SIE data.
