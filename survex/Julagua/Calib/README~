Coordinate systems
==================

We have used several different coordinate systems in the past.  The source of
all entrance coordinates should be indicated as follows:

[GN] Gerhard Niklasch et al.'s surface survey from the late 1980s, documented
in OUCC Proc 13, using the European UTM datum.  This is highly accurate.

[GPS-WGS94] Readings from a GPS using the WGS94 UTM datum.

[GPS-Euro] Readings from a GPS using the European datum.

[Old] Old entrance coordinate system, relative to Verdelluenga, using magnetic
north from an unknown year (possibly mixed with some grid norths).  Most of
these are derived from [GN], but some have been tied in via surface survey
(often ignoring magnetic deviation).

In future, we should locate only using the European UTM datum.  

Experiments in 2000 suggested that [GPS-WGS94] differs from [GN] by (107,205),
and that [GPS-Euro] differs from [GN] by (-5,5).  However, in theory the
difference is (109.49, 211.49), and that is the figure used in the
translations.  Here are figures for translating *from* various formats into
European datum:

[GPS-WGS94] add (109.49, 211.49)
[Old]       add (2333.6, 7815.3)


Declination
===========

Declination is as follows; data from www.ngdc.noaa.gov/seg/potfld/geomag.html

  1979.58   -6d  39.2m
  1980.58   -6d  30.0m
  1981.58   -6d  20.9m
  1982.58   -6d  11.8m
  1983.58   -6d   2.7m
  1984.58   -5d  53.7m
  1985.58   -5d  45.0m
  1986.58   -5d  36.5m
  1987.58   -5d  28.0m
  1988.58   -5d  19.5m
  1989.58   -5d  11.1m
  1990.58   -5d   3.2m
  1991.58   -4d  55.6m
  1992.58   -4d  48.1m
  1993.58   -4d  40.6m
  1994.58   -4d  33.0m
  1995.58   -4d  24.6m
  1996.58   -4d  15.6m
  1997.58   -4d   6.6m
  1998.58   -3d  57.6m
  1999.58   -3d  48.6m
  2000.58   -3d  40.0m
  2001.58   -3d  31.7m

Convergence is +1.31 degrees

Following figures from
http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/seg/geomag/jsp/struts/calcDeclination, calculated in
2006, based on Latitude 43.24 N, 4.89 W.

  2000.7.15  3d 39'W
  2001.7.15  3d 31'W
  2002.7.15  3d 22'W
  2003.7.15  3d 14'W
  2004.7.15  3d 06'W
  2005.7.15  2d 58'W
  2006.7.15  2d 50'W
  2007.7.15  2d 43'W
  2008.7.15  2d 35'W
   
So GPS bearing =(ish) grid bearing = mag bearing + declination + convergence
and declination + convergence = -2.36 (2000) increasing by 0.138 degrees per
year roughly.  Or more precisely:

  1981 	5.03
  1982	4.89
  1983  4.74
  1984  4.59
  1985  4.44
  1986  4.30
  1987  4.16
  1988  4.02
  1989  3.88
  1990  3.74
  1991  3.62
  1992  3.49
  1993  3.37
  1994  3.24
  1995  3.10
  1996  2.95
  1997	2.80
  1998	2.65
  1999	2.50
  2000	2.36
