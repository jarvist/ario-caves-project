;*equate texa_2008_04.12 texa_05_07.001 ; Not 100% sure this is correct. Equated upstream of lake from 2008 survey with boulder at far end of pool from 2005
 
*equate texa_2008_04.13 texa_05_07.002 ; Not 100% sure this is correct, but better than any of the other options, and is almost consistent with LRUD data

;*equate texa_2008_04.1 texa_2008_01.37 ; Not 100% sure this is correct either. But it is perhaps logical they would have surveyed as far up as the previous trips survey, right? No, because the survey states it starts at the bottom of the final waterfall
			; staion 14 is triangle on right hand side

*equate texa_2008_05.200 texa_2008_01.2 ; Since first survey leg is up pitcht o sump bypass, tie to survey station at bottom of pitch from 2008_01 survey, as this is well positioned wrt Spanish survey
