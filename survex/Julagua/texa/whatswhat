texa_2008_01 Upper streamway, downstream sump. 0 = bottom of rope of spanish pitch to streamway, 37 = upper bolt of pitch head

texa_2008_05 Upper streamway jam sump to camp

_98_03 - Spanish pitches to upstream sumps
Issues:
-------

* Survey from upper upstream sump (jam) to camp doesn't connect at quite the right point (but only a few metres off) _2008_05
* Does the _2008_01 start from the right point (first half of upper streamway connection?
* Connecting in the upper streamway lower half of connection to right place
* Check _05_07 lower streamway to waterfall starts from right point

* CALIBRATIONS. Find calibration for 05/08/09
